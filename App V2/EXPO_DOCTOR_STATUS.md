# Expo Doctor Status

## Current Status: 14/16 Checks Passing ✅

### Fixed Issues
- ✅ **Dependencies**: Removed `@types/react-native` from devDependencies (not needed with React Native)
- ✅ **Peer Dependencies**: Installed missing dependencies required by expo-router and react-native-tab-view:
  - `expo-linking`
  - `expo-status-bar` 
  - `react-native-pager-view`
- ✅ **Version Compatibility**: Fixed @expo/config-plugins version (now using 8.0.11 compatible with SDK 51)

### Remaining Warnings (Non-Critical)

#### 1. Expo Config Schema Check ❌
**Issue**: Network connectivity to exp.host  
**Status**: Infrastructure issue, not a code problem  
**Action**: None required

#### 2. Native Configuration Warning ⚠️
**Issue**: Project has both native folders (`android/`) and native config in `app.json`  
**Status**: Intentional hybrid approach  
**Details**: 
- When native folders exist, EAS Build doesn't sync these app.json properties: `scheme`, `orientation`, `icon`, `splash`, `ios`, `android`, `plugins`
- This project uses a hybrid approach:
  - Complex native config (permissions, Google Maps) managed in native files
  - Expo-managed config (Firebase, EAS project ID) in app.json
- This is a valid architectural choice for apps needing both native customization and Expo tooling

## Recommendation
The current configuration is working correctly. The 2 remaining "failed" checks are:
1. A network issue (not fixable in code)
2. An informational warning about the intentional hybrid native/Expo configuration

No further action is needed unless you want to migrate to a pure Expo-managed or pure native configuration approach.
