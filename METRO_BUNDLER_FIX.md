# Metro Bundler Script Loading Fix - Verification

This fix resolves the Metro bundler error: "Unable to load script. Make sure you're either running Metro (run 'npx react-native start') or that your bundle 'index.android.bundle is packaged correctly for release."

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced App V2/metro.config.js
- Added Firebase compatibility fixes
- Added .cjs extension support 
- Disabled unstable package exports feature
- Improved module resolution for CommonJS/ESM packages

### 2. Fixed handymanapp Dependencies
- Added missing source code from App V2/src
- Reinstalled Firebase with proper auth module
- Added missing navigation dependencies
- Fixed app.json web output configuration

### 3. Install Missing Dependencies
- Installed node_modules in App V2
- Updated package dependencies to resolve version conflicts

## Verification Commands

Test Metro bundler functionality:

```bash
# Test App V2 bundle generation
cd "App V2"
npx expo export --output-dir ./dist --platform android

# Test handymanapp bundle generation  
cd handymanapp
npx expo export --output-dir ./dist --platform android

# Test traditional React Native bundle
cd "App V2"
npx react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file node_modules/expo-router/entry.js --bundle-output ./bundle.js

# Test Metro bundler startup
npx expo start --no-dev
```

All commands should now execute successfully without module resolution errors.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by:
1. **Missing dependencies** - App V2 had no node_modules installed
2. **Basic Metro configuration** - App V2 used default config without Firebase/module resolution fixes
3. **Missing source files** - handymanapp was missing src directory and had incomplete dependencies
4. **Module resolution conflicts** - Firebase and navigation packages needed specific resolution settings

The fix implements the proven Metro configuration from handymanapp with proper Firebase compatibility and ensures all projects have complete dependencies and source code.
