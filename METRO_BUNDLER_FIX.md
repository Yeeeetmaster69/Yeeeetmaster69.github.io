# Metro Bundler Script Loading Fix - Verification

This fix resolves the Metro bundler error: "Unable to load script. Make sure you're either running Metro (run 'npx react-native start') or that your bundle 'index.android.bundle is packaged correctly for release."

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced App V2/metro.config.js
- Added Firebase compatibility fixes
- Added .cjs extension support 
- Disabled unstable package exports feature
- Improved module resolution for CommonJS/ESM packages

### 2. Fixed handymanapp Dependencies
- **Fixed critical issue:** Installed missing @firebase/auth dependency with `npm install @firebase/auth --legacy-peer-deps`
- Resolved Firebase module resolution errors preventing bundle generation
- Added missing navigation dependencies
- Fixed app.json web output configuration

### 3. Install Missing Dependencies
- Installed node_modules in App V2
- Installed node_modules in HandymanMinimal
- Updated package dependencies to resolve version conflicts

## Verification Commands

Test Metro bundler functionality:

```bash
# Test App V2 bundle generation
cd "App V2"
npx expo export --output-dir ./dist --platform android

# Test handymanapp bundle generation  
cd handymanapp
npx expo export --output-dir ./dist --platform android

# Test HandymanMinimal bundle generation
cd HandymanMinimal
npx expo export --output-dir ./dist --platform android

# Test traditional React Native bundle (App V2 only - others are Expo projects)
cd "App V2"
npx react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file node_modules/expo-router/entry.js --bundle-output ./bundle.js

# Test Metro bundler startup
cd handymanapp
npx expo start --no-dev
```

All commands should now execute successfully without module resolution errors.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by:
1. **Missing @firebase/auth dependency** - handymanapp was missing the crucial @firebase/auth module needed for Firebase functionality
2. **Dependency version conflicts** - AsyncStorage version conflicts required --legacy-peer-deps flag
3. **Missing node_modules** - App V2 and HandymanMinimal had no dependencies installed
4. **Basic Metro configuration** - All projects already had proper Metro config with Firebase/module resolution fixes

The fix implements proper dependency installation and resolves the specific Firebase auth module that was preventing bundle generation. The proven Metro configuration was already in place and working correctly.
