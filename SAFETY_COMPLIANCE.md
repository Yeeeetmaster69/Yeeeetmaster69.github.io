# Safety & Compliance System

This document outlines the requirements and proposed architecture for the Safety & Compliance features in the Handyman Pro application, including Incident Reporting, Emergency Contact/SOS functionality, and Background Checks integration.

## Overview

The Safety & Compliance system ensures worker and client safety through three core components:
1. **Incident Reporting** - Allow workers and clients to report safety incidents with documentation
2. **Emergency Contact/SOS** - Provide emergency assistance for on-site workers
3. **Background Checks** - Integrate background verification for worker onboarding

## Requirements

### 1. Incident Reporting System

#### User Stories
- **As a worker**, I want to report safety incidents during job execution so that proper documentation and follow-up can occur
- **As a client**, I want to report safety concerns or incidents related to work performed at my property
- **As an admin**, I want to review, track, and manage all reported incidents for compliance and safety improvement

#### Functional Requirements
- Workers and clients can create incident reports with the following information:
  - Incident type (injury, property damage, near miss, safety violation, other)
  - Date, time, and location of incident
  - Detailed description of what happened
  - Severity level (low, medium, high, critical)
  - Photos and documentation (up to 10 images)
  - Witness information (if applicable)
  - Immediate actions taken
- Reports are automatically timestamped and geo-tagged if location services are enabled
- Workers can report incidents related to specific jobs
- Clients can report incidents related to completed or ongoing work
- Admins can review, investigate, and close incidents
- Automated notifications to relevant parties based on severity
- Integration with job records for incident tracking

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- Reports must be submitted within 24 hours for time-sensitive incidents
- Photos must be automatically uploaded to secure cloud storage
- All incident data must be encrypted and access-controlled
- System must support offline report creation with sync when connectivity returns

### 2. Emergency Contact/SOS System

#### User Stories
- **As a worker**, I want to quickly contact emergency services or designated contacts if I'm in danger on a job site
- **As an admin**, I want to be notified immediately when a worker activates emergency protocols
- **As an emergency contact**, I want to receive location and context information when a worker needs help

#### Functional Requirements
- One-tap SOS button accessible from all worker app screens
- Automatic location sharing when SOS is activated
- Configurable emergency contact list (911, company emergency line, supervisors, family)
- Progressive escalation system:
  1. Send alert to company emergency contact
  2. If no response in 5 minutes, escalate to supervisor
  3. If no response in 10 minutes, contact emergency services
- Workers can set up personal emergency contacts during onboarding
- Real-time location tracking during emergency situations
- Emergency status visible to admins with ability to dispatch help
- Silent alarm option for situations where noise could increase danger
- Check-in system for lone workers (configurable intervals)

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- SOS activation must work even with poor cellular coverage
- Location accuracy within 10 meters when GPS is available
- Emergency contacts notified within 30 seconds of activation
- System must function offline and sync when connection is restored
- Battery optimization to prevent drain during emergencies

### 3. Background Checks Integration

#### User Stories
- **As an admin**, I want to verify worker backgrounds before allowing them to accept jobs
- **As a client**, I want assurance that workers have been properly vetted
- **As a worker**, I want a streamlined background check process during onboarding

#### Functional Requirements
- Integration with third-party background check providers (Checkr, Sterling, etc.)
- Support for different background check levels:
  - Basic criminal history
  - Extended criminal history
  - Motor vehicle records (for workers who drive)
  - Identity verification
  - Professional license verification
- Automated workflow for new worker onboarding
- Background check status tracking and expiration monitoring
- Configurable requirements based on job type or client preferences
- Secure document storage for background check results
- Compliance reporting for regulatory requirements
- Re-verification scheduling for expired checks

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- Background check results must be stored securely and access-controlled
- Integration API calls must be encrypted and logged
- System must comply with relevant employment and privacy laws
- Results must be processed and available within 48-72 hours

## Proposed Architecture

### Database Schema Extensions

### User Interface Design

#### Worker Interface
- **Safety Dashboard**: Quick access to incident reporting, SOS button, and safety resources
- **Incident Report Form**: Step-by-step form with photo upload and offline capability
- **Emergency Button**: Prominent, always-accessible SOS functionality
- **Check-in System**: Automated prompts for lone worker check-ins
- **Safety Profile**: View background check status and emergency contacts

#### Client Interface
- **Report Incident**: Simplified incident reporting for property or service issues
- **Worker Safety Info**: View worker background check status (privacy-compliant)
- **Emergency Contact**: Access to report concerns about worker safety

#### Admin Interface
- **Incident Management Dashboard**: Overview of all incidents with filtering and search
- **Emergency Response Center**: Real-time SOS monitoring and response tools
- **Background Check Console**: Manage worker verification process and renewals
- **Safety Analytics**: Reports on incident trends and safety metrics
- **Compliance Center**: Regulatory reporting and documentation management

### Integration Points

#### External Services
- **Background Check Providers**: API integration with Checkr, Sterling, or similar services
- **Emergency Services**: SMS/phone integration for automated emergency notifications
- **Mapping Services**: Google Maps or similar for location services and geocoding
- **Document Storage**: Firebase Storage with encryption for sensitive documents

#### Existing Features
- **User Management**: Leverage existing role-based access control
- **Job System**: Link incidents to specific jobs for better tracking
- **Notification System**: Extend existing push notifications for safety alerts
- **Photo Upload**: Use existing image handling system for incident documentation

### Security & Privacy Considerations

#### Data Protection
- All incident reports and background check data encrypted at rest and in transit
- Access controls based on role and need-to-know basis
- Regular data retention policy with automatic purging of expired records
- Audit logging for all access to sensitive safety data

#### Privacy Compliance
- Worker consent required for background checks and emergency contact sharing
- Client notification when incidents are reported on their property
- GDPR/CCPA compliance for data handling and deletion requests
- Anonymous reporting option for certain incident types

#### Emergency Protocols
- SOS system must function independently of regular app authentication
- Emergency contact information stored locally for offline access
- Automatic location sharing only during active emergencies
- Clear escalation procedures with defined response timeframes
