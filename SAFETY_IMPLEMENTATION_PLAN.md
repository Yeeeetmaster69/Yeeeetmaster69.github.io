# Safety & Compliance Implementation Plan

This document outlines the technical implementation steps for the Safety & Compliance features described in `SAFETY_COMPLIANCE.md`.

## Phase 1: Database Foundation (Week 1)

### Firestore Schema Implementation
- [ ] Create `incidents` collection with security rules
- [ ] Create `emergency_contacts` collection with security rules  
- [ ] Create `sos_events` collection with security rules
- [ ] Create `background_checks` collection with security rules
- [ ] Create `worker_check_ins` collection with security rules
- [ ] Update Firestore indexes for new collections
- [ ] Test data model with sample documents

### Security Rules
```javascript
// Add to firestore.rules
match /incidents/{incidentId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null && (
    resource.data.reporterId == request.auth.uid ||
    get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin'
  );
  allow create: if request.auth != null;
  allow update: if request.auth != null && 
    get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
}

match /emergency_contacts/{contactId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
}

match /sos_events/{eventId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null && (
    resource.data.workerId == request.auth.uid ||
    get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin'
  );
  allow create: if request.auth != null;
  allow update: if request.auth != null && 
    get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
}

match /background_checks/{checkId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null && (
    resource.data.workerId == request.auth.uid ||
    get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin'
  );
  allow write: if request.auth != null && 
    get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
}
```

## Phase 2: Core Components (Week 2)

### React Native Components

#### 1. Incident Reporting

- [ ] `PhotoUploadComponent.tsx` - Multi-photo upload with compression

#### 2. Emergency System
- [ ] `SOSButton.tsx` - Emergency button component
- [ ] `EmergencyContactsScreen.tsx` - Manage emergency contacts
- [ ] `SOSResponseScreen.tsx` - Admin emergency response interface
- [ ] `LocationService.ts` - Background location tracking service
- [ ] `EmergencyNotificationService.ts` - Handle emergency escalation

#### 3. Background Checks
- [ ] `BackgroundCheckScreen.tsx` - View check status (worker)
- [ ] `BackgroundCheckAdminScreen.tsx` - Manage checks (admin)
- [ ] `BackgroundCheckService.ts` - External API integration
- [ ] `OnboardingWizard.tsx` - Include background check in onboarding

### Navigation Updates
```typescript
// Add to navigation stack
type SafetyStackParamList = {
  IncidentReport: undefined;
  IncidentList: undefined;
  IncidentDetail: { incidentId: string };
  EmergencyContacts: undefined;
  BackgroundCheck: undefined;
  SOSResponse: { eventId: string };
};
```

## Phase 3: Services & APIs (Week 3)

### Background Check Integration
- [ ] Choose provider (Checkr, Sterling, etc.)
- [ ] Implement API wrapper service
- [ ] Create webhook endpoint for status updates
- [ ] Add provider credentials to environment config
- [ ] Test with sandbox environment

### Emergency Services
- [ ] SMS/phone integration (Twilio recommended)
- [ ] Location services with offline capability
- [ ] Push notification enhancements for emergencies
- [ ] Escalation timer service
- [ ] Emergency contact validation

### Cloud Functions
```typescript
// Add to server/functions/
exports.processBackgroundCheck = functions.firestore
  .document('background_checks/{checkId}')
  .onCreate(async (snap, context) => {
    // Trigger external background check
  });

exports.handleSOSEvent = functions.firestore
  .document('sos_events/{eventId}')
  .onCreate(async (snap, context) => {
    // Send emergency notifications
  });

exports.escalateEmergency = functions.pubsub
  .schedule('every 1 minutes')
  .onRun(async (context) => {
    // Check for unresponded SOS events
  });
```

## Phase 4: UI Implementation (Week 4)

### Worker Interface
